# Protein-Sequence-Converter-NPY-to-FASTA
This repository hosts a Python script designed to facilitate the conversion of protein sequences stored in NumPy files (.npy) into the FASTA format (.fasta). The script serves as a convenient tool, particularly useful for bioinformatics applications, and specifically intended for use with the Alphamode Multimer AI model.
